Part 1: Data Modeling
In the first part of the assignment, you will focus on data modeling. You are required to:

Define Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs): Create a detailed ERD that represents the relationships between various entities in a given dataset.
Identify Primary and Foreign Keys: Clearly identify the primary keys and foreign keys in your ERD.
Normalize Data: Apply normalization techniques to optimize the data structure and minimize redundancy.
Part 2: Data Engineering
In the second part, you will delve into data engineering tasks. Your tasks include:

Data Extraction: Extract relevant data from a provided data source, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
Data Transformation: Cleanse and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
Data Loading: Load the transformed data into a database management system of your choice, organizing it efficiently.
Part 3: Data Analysis
The final part of the assignment will involve data analysis. You will:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA techniques to gain insights into the dataset, including summary statistics, data distributions, and initial visualizations.
Hypothesis Testing: Formulate hypotheses based on the dataset and conduct appropriate statistical tests to validate or reject them.
Data Visualization: Create informative data visualizations to present your findings effectively.
